# The-Medieval-Humours
This project demonstrates how the medieval humours were used in medicine through the form of urine testing. The user simply presses the button, and the wheel spins to reveal various colours in the urine flask. The colour of urine represented which homour was out of balance, through which this became a method of diagnosis.
