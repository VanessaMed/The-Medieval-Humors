# The-Medieval-Humors

The Project:

This project demonstrates how the medieval humors were used in medicine through the form of urine testing. The user simply presses the button, and the wheel spins to reveal the various colours accociated with urine in respect to humoral theory.

History of Medieval Urine Testing:

The urine flask, referred to as a matula, was a traditional symbol of medieval physicians. By examining the colour, texture, and taste of a urine sample, the physician could tell whether or not a patient’s humors were balanced. The classical humoral theory states that the body was composed of four humors: black bile (dry and cold), yellow bile (dry and hot), phlegm (moist and cold), and blood (moist and hot). Optimal health was representative of humoral equilibrium, whereas illness resulted from an imbalance. If one humor was out of balance, then the opposite was applied. Furthermore, health and treatment regimens were directly related to diet. For example, if one’s face was especially red, this would signify an increase in blood. To re-balance the level of blood with respect to the other humors, the physician could bleed the patient. If a patient lacked blood relative to the other humors, a diet of meat and eggs (hot and warm) foods would be prescribed. 
	The humors governed the entire body. Medieval and classical physicians believed the stomach was the location where food was “cooked” (i.e. digested) and turned into blood. The process of this “cooking” was reflective in one’s urine. Urine that was too dark, for instance, indicated that the food in the stomach was being overcooked. The stomach, as a result, would require a diet consisting of more “hot” foods to add heat and aid the digestion process. 
	The “urine wheel” portrayed 20 different colours of urine and acted as a guide for physicians to follow. If contents of the urine was lighter, and floated to the top of the flask, this would typically be associated with the state of one’s head. Heaver sediments that floated to the bottom would represent the state of the organs one’s lower body, such as the kidneys. The physician’s examination of urine was the best way to determine the state of one’s humoral balance and prescribe an appropriate regimen to regain an equilibrium.

The Process:

Originally we wanted to create a project that in some way encapsulated medieval history and allowed visitors to somehow change the state of the exhibit. Because the real past is inaccessible, it was important to create a simulation that somewhat transported the user. The method in which this method was executed, changed as our project design developed. We had brainstormed ideas that involved medieval music, medicine and torture. We had decided to go with the ideal showcasing medieval methods of torture.  

This idea had gone through a few drafts, involving different instruments of torture and ways the user could immerse themselves by carrying out the torture on a "gummy person". For example, cranking a handle to stretch the "gummy person" on a piece of torture equipment called 'The Rack', and other instruments such as a brazing bull, wheel and spiked chair. We discussed the use of audio and vinyl as a part of the "dungeon" design. The user would be able to physically touch the methods of torture.  In addition each user would be assigned a different card with a given crime, respective punishment, and chances of death. While discussing what parts to use and the 'execution' of our project (pun intended), the conversation turned to discussing plague masks and disease. It was at that point, during our excitement, that we decided to make our exhibit about disease. This is where the idea for the Urine Wheel originated. 

The concept for the Urine Wheel took many shapes. The first being we wanted the "wheel" to be in the shape of a man who's humors were out of balance. The humors would be in a serious of valves that needed readjusting by the user in order to "balance" them out. This idea evolved into the analyzing of humor imbalances through urine testing. The wheel began as a 2d design, but as we began working on it, we decided to make it into a 3d model. After making the prototype out of cardboard, the final design mainly consisted of foam and hard stock covered Styrofoam.
